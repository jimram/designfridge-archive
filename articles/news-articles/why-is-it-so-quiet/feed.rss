		<description>I am one of this crowd of fans hoping, yearning for a post or other sign of life. I let out a small sigh every time I am denied this small pleasure, which, sadly, reveals the troubled state of my internet habits.

P.S. I&#039;m with Robert I love your taste.</description>

		<description>I was starting to get worried. I checked your twitter feed to make sure you were not dead or injured or stuck in crevasse somewhere. 

I still kept faithfully checking the site every few days to for my design hit.

Soooo glad you are back don&#039;t ever leave me again.

There are lots of design aggregators out there but I love your taste. The next time you decide to take a break remember somewhere there will be a sad Irish man constantly hitting refresh on his browser waiting for your return.

Keep up the awesome work and congrats on the baby!</description>
