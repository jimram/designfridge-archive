		<description>Hi Jim,

Firstly congratulations. 5000 sites is quite a feat. I&#039;ve certainly found this site to be a great source of inspiration over the past couple of years.</description>

		<description>Congratulations for hitting 5000! 

Agree with the first post, you definitely don&#039;t get the recognition you deserve. Never a day passes without having a look at what&#039;s new! Keep up the good work and here&#039;s to the next 5000!</description>

		<description>Congrats!

The design is already very nice, but I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll think of ways to improve it. Unfortunately, I can&#039;t. Haha.</description>

		<description>Oh, and as a possible improvement...

It would be cool if we hovered over the images and got a screenshot of the entire site... sort of like the thumbnails you get in your default Chrome or Safari startpages.

Whatcha think?</description>

		<description>You&#039;ve created one of the best inspiration sites on the net, dude. Please keep it up.

I visit daily.... heck, I&#039;d pay a monthly fee to get the content you collect.

Cheers from Canada!

		<description>Since you tag each entry with multiple tags, would it not be possible to sift through the entries by selecting multiple tags, instead of only being able to choose one? I would really like to see this happen!

Tremendous efforts in maintaining this site. It&#039;s a great resource for me and many others. Thank you!</description>
