		<description>@Ben - It&#039;s a pretty uninspiring collection of sites IMO. Some of them have been kicking about for a few years. Leads me to wonder what criteria each category is judged on. :/

@daniel yes lots of flash! It looks like thats the only way to a Webby. Although it will be interesting to see the difference next year, given the increasing use of CSS/jQuery and lack of flash support for iPad/iPhone.

Did you see what Steve Jobs wrote on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;apple blog&lt;/a&gt;?</description>

		<description>Can&#039;t really say I&#039;m completely bowled over by most of these sites, it&#039;s a given though some of the content is great on these sites and still loving the They Make Apps navigational structure and design but HBO&#039;s load time could be considered slow which is intrusive to the user experience. Hell what do I know anyway ;-)</description>
