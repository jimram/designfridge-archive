		<description>Full of bugs. Horrible interface. Poor version for iPad. HTML5 totally detracts from content.

Journalism is about the content, not about the paper it&#039;s written on. Do I really need the index on EVERY PAGE of a book that I am reading? Am I so moronic that I cannot navigate a book by myself? Why have all that distraction just because its a web page!!!

So much time, effort and money spent on eye candy</description>
