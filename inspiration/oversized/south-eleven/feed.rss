		<description>You could try performing a wall of enormous squares in alternating colors, use vertical 
panels of color, add lines of horizontal type in a contrasting shade, or go full-scale and paint a mural on an entire wall.</description>

		<description>Right up front let me say I have worked with some of the individuals at south &amp; eleven on web and book design, so I do have a bias in favor of them.  I have always liked their designs - clean, strong, with an understated elegance, and usable.  For a writer/editor/publisher this last bit - simplicity of use - is I think one of the most overlooked aspects of design.   I like the way these qualities translate here to their site.
And this is my first experience with your site.  Kudos for making it welcoming, interesting and in its variety thought-provoking for those of us outside the design industry.</description>
