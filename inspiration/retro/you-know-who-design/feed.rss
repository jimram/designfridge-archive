		<description>Agreed. That logo is great, but I don&#039;t get the whole retro aspect.</description>

		<description>Lovely branding but the site doesn&#039;t seem very balanced and I don&#039;t really get the retro feel, mailchimp pull it off so well but here it feels like there needed to be &#039;something&#039; when the design work speaks for itself.

Such a nice brand though, brought through to favicon expertly.</description>
