		<description>Apple can make their camera work with the + button, good for them, but that will never make the iPhone feel more like a camera, I&#039;ve had a touch, a feel and a go with the prototype Red Pop, (Brendan is my brother in law) and it feels great. The button - a real moving button - makes all the difference to the feel of taking pictures on the iPhone, Red Pop makes holding the phone for pictures super stable.

I&#039;ve been messing with my phone using my finger and thumb to press the + button as if taking pictures and it&#039;s fiddly, I don&#039;t have some big old franken-fingers, I have regular size hands, and it&#039;s still fiddly, I use my iPhone without a case and it&#039;s slippery as hell, with Red Pop those problems are gone. Old hands and stiff fingers or just young and clumsy? Yeah, you need Red Pop too.

Oh, and no, I&#039;m not getting one for free, I like it so much I&#039;m paying for mine.</description>
