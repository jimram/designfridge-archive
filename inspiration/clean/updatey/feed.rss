		<description>Hey, thanks for featuring us. Happy to answer any questions, if there are any.

Most importantly, we&#039;d love to know what the wider design community thinks of Updatey (both from a design standpoint, as well as a tool to use with your clients to help increase transparency and engagement once a project has kicked off :)

Thanks again,

Ben
